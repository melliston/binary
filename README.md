# Binary
This project is a learning exercise.

After reading an excellent book by Charles Petzold, Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software. I learnt how the binary adder worked so I decided to implement it into JS.

I aim to add some other functions such as subtract in the future.
