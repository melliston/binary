# Binary
This project is a learning exercise.

After reading an excellent book by Charles Petzold, Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software. I learnt how the binary adder worked so I decided to implement it into JS.

I aim to add some other functions such as subtract in the future.

# Usage

```javascript
const result = add([0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]);
console.log('Result:', result);
```

The above will then output:

```javascript
Result: [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1 ]
```
